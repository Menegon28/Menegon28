## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an MSc student in [Statistics](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2025/LM/SC/SC3012) with a focus on Data Science at the [University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it/en/), passionate about data, AI/ML, and technology.  
My academic interests include computational statistics, statistical modeling, and high-dimensional multivariate data analysis. I also engage with social statistics, with my bachelor's thesis focusing on electoral data.
I am also interested in AI/ML more broadly and keep up with the latest developments in Large Language Model research.  
As a personal interest, I enjoy studying privacy, security, and anonymity solutions for the web.
